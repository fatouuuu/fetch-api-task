notes on fetch api:

The Fetch API is a promise-based interface for fetching resources 
asynchronously by making HTTP requests to servers from web browsers. 

The Fetch API provides a JavaScript interface for accessing and 
manipulating parts of the HTTP pipeline, such as requests and responses.

---> The URL
---> HTTP verb
---> The fetch() method itself

The fetch() method takes one mandatory argument, the path to the 
resource you want to fetch. It returns a Promise that resolves to 
the Response to that request, whether it is successful or not. 
You can also optionally pass in an init options object as the 
second argument. Once a response is retrieved, there are a number 
of methods available to define what the body content is and how it 
should be handled. 

requests: 
  - making a call to an existing endpoint that has some data
    held within it.
  - URL and HTTP verb (GET, POST(body/payload), PUT(body/payload),
    PATCH(body/payload), DELETE)

responses:
  - information that is returned back to us upon making a request.
  - can be positive(success) or negative(failure)
